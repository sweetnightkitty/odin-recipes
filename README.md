# odin-recipes
This was a project I started for training purposes while completing the Odin Project.


# Start Date: July 3, 2023
Combine command, git, HTML to create a recipe project.

# Update: July 11, 2023 Add basic CSS
-Add stylesheet: update font-family, font-size
-Resize and center header images universally
-Convert Ingredients section to a div, center text, and convert ul to inline-block with left-align
-Apply background-color to Ingredients div for practice
Final thoughts: How to cut off background-color in div.ingredients so that it does not run from the entire left to right of the viewport.


# Update: August 18, 2023 Flexbox
At this time I began to incorporate Flexbox into the website design and created a header and navigation bar.
