# Odin Recipes
This was a project I started for training purposes while completing the Odin Project.
This project began as a simple HTML file, and was updated as I mastered new skills in HTML, and CSS/flexbox, and incorporated a log-in page.

This was one of my first projects ever, and for that reason it is very simple but I am absolutely proud to have begun this wonderful, crazy, and thrilling adventure into web development. 

If you happen to be viewing this project I can't promise you will be impressed but hopefully this reminds you of where your career began, and puts a smile on your face.

## How this project evolved:

### Start Date: July 3, 2023
Wrote a basic HTML bare-bones markup.

### Update: July 11, 2023 Add basic CSS

After learning more about HTML basics and CSS, I began to introduce divs into my HTML layout, and made basic style changes with CSS.

### Update: August 18, 2023 Flexbox

After learning about the fundamentals of CSS Flexbox, I began to incorporate this into my website design and created a simple header and nav bar.

## Getting Started

If you want, you're welcome to fork and clone this to your local environment and check it out. It's very simple and will run right out of the box.
