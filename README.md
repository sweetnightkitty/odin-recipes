# odin-recipes
This was a project I started for training purposes while completing the Odin Project.
This project began as a simple HTML file, and was updated as I mastered new skills in HTML, CSS/flexbox, and incorporated a log-in page.

# Start Date: July 3, 2023
Combine command, git, HTML to create the basic recipe project.

# Update: July 11, 2023 Add basic CSS
- After learning basic HTML elements, began to introduce divs to html structure.
- After learning basic css, added stylesheet and updated font-family, font-size etc.

# Update: August 18, 2023 Flexbox
At this time I began to incorporate Flexbox into the website design and created a header and navigation bar.
