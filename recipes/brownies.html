    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you like your brownies chewy, gooey and extra chocolatey – then these one-bowl chewy brownies are for you! Made with oil and cocoa powder so you likely won’t even need an extra grocery trip, they’re waaayyy better than boxed brownies!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil or canola oil</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk discard the white</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chocolate chips semi-sweet or dark</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350F degrees. </li>
        <li>Line an 8x8 inch metal baking pan* with aluminium foil and grease lightly, or line with parchment paper</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the oil and sugar.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the eggs, extra egg yolk and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Gently stir in the flour and cocoa powder. If needed, give the mixture a whisk to remove any lumps.*</li>
        <li>Then fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into your prepared pan and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top looks set and an inserted toothpick comes out clean or with a few damp crumbs.</li>
        <li>Cool and then cut into bars. I let mine cool for over 2 hours before slicing for the photographs (you'll notice that the insides were still warm and melty).</li>
    </ol>
