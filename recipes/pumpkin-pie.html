    <h1>No Bake Pumpkin Pie</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We are ramping up for PIE season around Crazy for Crust headquarters (aka my kitchen). I’ve got a TON of new ones to share in the coming months, but today I wanted to start with something EASY.</p>
    <p>It’s never too early for pumpkin pie, IMHO. This pumpkin pie is no bake, which is perfect for a few reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You run out of oven space.</li>
        <li>You don't feel like baking something</li>
        <li>It's still a bajillion degrees outside so turning on your oven seems ridiculous and you WANT PUMPKIN PIE NOW.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This pie is like a pumpkin cream pie; filled with a creamy pumpkin pie mixture with that telltale flavor. It’s all inside a graham cracker crust and topped with whipped cream.</p>
    <p>Cream pie is my jam, if you were curious. I can go to town on a cream pie; it’s safer to get them out of my house ASAP or I’ll just eat the entire thing with a fork. Cream pies go down so easy and are so flavorful.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>1 3.4 ounce box instant vanilla pudding</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>8 ounces Cool Whip (1 full 8 ounce container)</li>
        <li>1 (9-inch) graham cracker crust (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>Whipped Cream for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together pumpkin puree, pudding mix, milk, and pumpkin pie spice. Stir until no lumps remain.</li>
        <li>Carefully fold in Cool Whip.</li>
        <li>Spread pumpkin mixture in prepared crust. Chill at least 3 hours or until it sets enough to slice. Serve with whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
